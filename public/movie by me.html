<h1>The Best Movies According to Sagar Pundir</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Baghban</h3>
<p>This is my favourite one. A Family movie the story is too good and emotional and gives us too important moral.</p>
<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>Again this movie tells you thatnever chase the success always give your best efforts and now the success will chase you.</p>
<h3>12th fail</h3>
<p>This movie tells you that your success is not depend on your financial background all thing is that how much hardwork and efforts you put to get your dream.</p>
